# ü•™ Love Sandwiches

Love Sandwiches is a Python-based automation project that helps a fictional sandwich business manage stock more efficiently.  
The program collects sales data, calculates surplus, and generates recommended stock levels for the next market day. All integrated with **Google Sheets** for real-time updates.

## üìå Project Overview

The program includes:

- **Sales Data Input**  
  Collects 6 numbers (one per sandwich type) entered by the user and validates the input.

- **Automated Worksheet Updates**  
  New rows are automatically added to the **Sales**, **Surplus**, and **Stock** worksheets.

- **Surplus Calculation**  
  Compares sales with available stock to identify waste (positive values) or shortages (negative values).

- **Smart Stock Prediction**  
  Analyzes the last 5 entries of sales for each sandwich, calculates the average, adds 10%, and suggests how many sandwiches to prepare.

- **Clear Output**  
  Displays a summary in the terminal showing the recommended stock levels for each sandwich type.
